## Adding a new baseline

1. Drop a new adapter in `rl_data/comparison/adapters/<my_ds>.py`:

   ```python
   from rl_data.comparison.adapters import Adapter, flatten_harbor_task, register_adapter

   class MyDatasetAdapter(Adapter):
       name = "my_ds"
       hf_repo_id = "org/my-dataset"
       default_dst = "rl_data/output/tasks_my_ds"
       def convert_one(self, src, dst_root):
           return flatten_harbor_task(src, dst_root,
               source_name="myds", source_repo=self.hf_repo_id)

   register_adapter(MyDatasetAdapter())
   ```

2. Add the import in `rl_data/comparison/adapters/__init__.py`.
3. Add a `scripts/comparison/run_ingest_my_ds.sh` shell launcher.
4. Pass it as another `--baseline` to the CLI.

Modules already accept a list of N datasets — no changes needed on the
analysis side.

### Baseline-specific quirks

- **TermiGen** (`ucsb-mlsec/terminal-bench-env`, ~3.5k tasks): lives on
  GitHub, not HF. The adapter does a `--filter=blob:none --sparse` clone of
  only `environments_harbor/` so we skip the large `termigen_env.zip`
  (TB-1.0 artifact, unused). Every upstream Dockerfile `FROM`s
  `ghcr.io/laude-institute/t-bench/ubuntu-24-04:20250624`; the solve script
  prebuilds a shared `tbench_ubuntu24_base.sif` once and the adapter
  rewrites each per-task `container.def`'s
  `Bootstrap:`/`From:` header to `localimage`/`./tbench_ubuntu24_base.sif`
  so per-task builds only layer the task-specific delta (payload files +
  any extra apt/pip beyond the common `python3-pip`/`pytest`/`pandas`/
  `scipy` that the base bakes in). The real verifier is `tests/test_outputs.py`
  (the sibling `tests/test.sh` is just a Harbor-style reward-logging wrapper
  around `pytest` on that file, which our harness runs directly).
- **OpenThoughts-Agent-v1-RL**: tarballed inside a single `tasks.parquet`;
  verifier is `tests/test.sh`, wrapped into a pytest adapter that invokes
  `bash /tests/test.sh`. See adapter docstring for the instruction rewrite
  that fixes the upstream "fabricate your own fixtures" prompt.
- **Endless-Terminals**: ships native `container.def`s with
  `From: ./ubuntu_22.04.sif`; the ET solve script prebuilds that base SIF
  with python3/pip/pytest preloaded.
- **TerminalTraj** (`m-a-p/TerminalTraj-5k-instances`, 5,660 tasks): shipped
  as a single 13 MB `5k_instances.tar.gz` on HF; the adapter uses
  `hf_hub_download` + `tarfile.extractall`, not `snapshot_download`. Uses
  the **TerminalBench 1.0** layout (task root with `Dockerfile`,
  `task.yaml`, `tests/test_outputs.py`) — not Harbor 2.0 — so
  `flatten_harbor_task` doesn't apply; we write a TB-1.0–specific converter.
  Every task `FROM`s a **unique** `yizhilll/tb_container-<md5>:tmux_asciinema_v2`
  image on Docker Hub (~400 MB each, all 5,660 distinct), so we can't
  pre-bake a shared base SIF the way we do for TermiGen/OT; per-task
  Docker pulls are unavoidable. The images span many distros (Debian/
  Ubuntu/Fedora/Alpine/…) with varying Python+pip availability, so the
  adapter injects a robust pytest bootstrap into `%post` that tries, in
  order: existing `pip3` → system package manager → `get-pip.py`.
  Separately, a few tasks (e.g. Fedora 27 with glibc<2.33) fail with
  Apptainer's bundled `fakeroot` binary; the solve script therefore
  pre-builds each per-task SIF with `--ignore-fakeroot-command` (which
  `generate_solutions.build_sif()` doesn't pass) before handing off to
  the harness. Native `category`/`difficulty`/`tags` in `task.yaml` are
  placeholder constants (`mathematics`/`easy`/`["mathematics"]`) across
  all 5,660 tasks, so domain/skill-type buckets rely entirely on the LLM
  classifier output.
- **CLI-Gym** (`hamishivi/agent-task-cli-gym`, 1,552 tasks → ~1,452
  ingested): SWE-Smith *environment-inversion* repair tasks. Each base is a
  real Python repo (faker/pandas/scrapy/…) installed at `/testbed` inside a
  conda env named `testbed`; the published image has had its **environment**
  deliberately corrupted (e.g. swapped glibc locale `language`/`territory`
  fields, poisoned codec registry, truncated shared lib) so a chosen subset
  of unit tests fails, and the agent must restore it. The verifier is **not**
  in the hamishivi parquet (its `dataset=passthrough` / `swerl_vanillux_sandbox`
  env defers reward to the environment), so the adapter loads two HF datasets
  and joins on `task_id`: images + prompts (the instruction, which is
  byte-identical to the upstream task.yaml) from `hamishivi/agent-task-cli-gym`,
  and the per-task run-tests.sh (the selected fail-to-pass + pass-to-pass unit
  tests) from the upstream release
  [`LiberCoders/CLI-Gym`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LiberCoders/CLI-Gym).
  (We read the instruction from the hamishivi prompt rather than the task.yaml
  because ~6 % of upstream task.yaml files have a malformed `instruction: |`
  block scalar; the prompt text is equivalent and always well-formed.)
  Like R2E Gym / TerminalTraj, every task `FROM`s its own pre-built
  `hamishi740/agent-task-cli-gym:<hash>` image (~900 MB, all distinct, public
  on Docker Hub), so no shared base SIF; the solve script pre-builds each with
  `--ignore-fakeroot-command`. `test_final_state.py` activates the `testbed`
  conda env and runs `pytest <selected UTs>`, passing iff **all** selected
  tests pass (= SWE-bench `ResolvedStatus.FULL`); the agent's environment fixes
  survive into the verifier because the harness holds one `--writable-tmpfs`
  instance across the rollout and the final test. Because the harness's outer
  `pytest pytest_final_state.py` runs from the **base** conda PATH (which ships
  no pytest), the adapter's `%post` installs/exposes a pytest there purely so
  the wrapper can be collected — the real run happens in `testbed`. ~6 % of
  CLI-Gym tasks select no explicit tests (whole-suite run); those are skipped
  as unverifiable. Native domain/difficulty metadata is absent, so taxonomy
  buckets rely entirely on the LLM classifier output.
- **SWE-smith** (`hamishivi/agent-task-swe-smith`, ~59k tasks): SWE-bench-style
  *synthetic bug-repair* tasks. Each base is a real Python repo (the same
  `jyangballin/swesmith.x86_64.<repo>.<sha>` family CLI-Gym builds on) installed
  editable at `/testbed` inside a conda env named `testbed`. SWE-smith generates
  thousands of synthetic bugs per repo by procedurally corrupting the **source
  code**; the agent must repair the source so a set of broken unit tests
  (`FAIL_TO_PASS`) passes again. The verifier is **not** in the hamishivi parquet
  (`dataset=passthrough` / `swerl_vanillux_sandbox`), so the adapter loads two HF
  datasets and joins on the instance slug (`task_id` == `instance_id`): images +
  prompts (the SWE-smith problem statement) from `hamishivi/agent-task-swe-smith`,
  and the per-instance bug patch + `FAIL_TO_PASS`/`PASS_TO_PASS` from the upstream
  release
  [`SWE-bench/SWE-smith`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-smith).
  **Key difference from CLI-Gym:** the `jyangballin/...` base image is *shared*
  across every bug instance of a `<repo>.<sha>` (one image, thousands of tasks)
  and ships the **clean** repo, so the per-instance bug is not baked in — the
  adapter ships the dataset `patch` (which, per the SWE-smith docs, is "the diff
  that creates the bug") into the SIF and `git apply`s it in `%post`, so
  `FAIL_TO_PASS` starts red. A task whose bug patch fails to apply produces no
  `container.sif` and is skipped (better than shipping a trivially-passing task);
  tasks with an empty bug patch or empty `FAIL_TO_PASS` are dropped at ingest.
  `test_final_state.py` activates the `testbed` conda env and runs
  `pytest <FAIL_TO_PASS>`, passing iff all of them pass; the ~500-670 `PASS_TO_PASS`
  no-regression tests are baked in too and additionally enforced when
  `APPTAINERENV_SWE_SMITH_CHECK_P2P=1` (off by default to bound runtime, mirroring
  CLI-Gym's selected-test verifier). As with CLI-Gym, the agent's source edits
  survive into the verifier via the harness's single `--writable-tmpfs` instance,
  and the `%post` exposes a base-conda pytest purely so the outer wrapper can be
  collected. Native domain/difficulty metadata is absent, so taxonomy buckets
  rely entirely on the LLM classifier output.

## Output layout (`rl_data/output/comparison/`)

Each figure ships with a co-located `.csv` holding the raw numbers so you can
replot in a custom style.

## Modules

1. **difficulty** — pass@1, pass@8, turns, tokens, cost per task, Mann–Whitney U.
2. **command_mix** — every bash tool call is tagged via
   `command_taxonomy.classify_one` (16 categories: file manip, code_write,
   code_run, pkg_install, service, db, net, ...); reports coverage, per-turn
   distribution, co-occurrence heatmaps. Uses **no metadata** → fully fair.
3. **composition** — projects each dataset onto OUR taxonomy on **four** axes
   (9 domains, ~29 skill_types, task complexity, command complexity) via the
   LLM classifier. `fig3_composition_domain.png` is the main-body chart;
   skill_type / complexity charts are in the appendix.
4. **diversity** — shared TF-IDF clustering on the union corpus.
5. **realism** — description length, apt+pip package counts, services started,
   artifacts checked by verifier.
6. **verifier** — `ast`-walks `test_final_state.py`: LOC, assert count,
   assertion-type distribution.

## Cost-bounded solve (SAMPLE_SIZE)

All four `run_generate_solutions_*.sh` scripts honour a `SAMPLE_SIZE` env
var that randomly subsamples tasks before solving, useful when you want
quick-turn comparisons without spending $30+:

```bash
# Solve only 250 randomly-sampled ET tasks with seed 42
SAMPLE_SIZE=250 SAMPLE_SEED=42 \
    bash rl_data/scripts/comparison/run_generate_solutions_et.sh
```

The sample is drawn from the filtered task set and is deterministic in
`SAMPLE_SEED` so reruns pick the same subset.

## pass@k breadth (NUM_SOLUTIONS)

All four solve scripts accept `NUM_SOLUTIONS` as an env override. The
harness's `run_n_solutions()` reports `pass@k` for every k in [1..N], so
`NUM_SOLUTIONS=8` gives you both `pass@1` and `pass@8` (and 2/3/4/5/6/7) in
one run. Default is `1` (matches the 10k gemini run).

```bash
# Pass@8 ET run with the API model
NUM_SOLUTIONS=8 sbatch rl_data/scripts/comparison/run_generate_solutions_et.sh
```

For local-model pass@k runs, see "Local models (vLLM / Ollama)" below.

## Local models (vLLM / Ollama)

The solver + classifier both use `litellm`, which supports local models via
OpenAI-compatible proxies out of the box. There are now **two** supported
flows: (A) one SLURM job that serves vLLM AND solves (recommended), or
(B) split serve and solve into two separate jobs (legacy).

### A. Single-job, in-job vLLM (recommended for pass@k with a local model)

Each `run_generate_solutions_*.sh` accepts `LAUNCH_VLLM=1`, which makes the
script bring up vLLM on the same node it allocates, wait for readiness, run
the solver against `http://127.0.0.1:<auto>/v1`, and tear vLLM down on exit.
For a single dataset:

```bash
LAUNCH_VLLM=1 NUM_SOLUTIONS=8 \
    sbatch rl_data/scripts/comparison/run_generate_solutions_et.sh
```

That single command gives you both `pass@1` and `pass@8` for ET under
`Qwen/Qwen3-8B` (the helper's default), with `_summary.json` filenames keyed
by model so existing gemini summaries are not overwritten.

For all four baselines under one shared vLLM (single 8xH200 allocation,
single weight load, no idle GPUs between datasets), use the orchestrator:

```bash
APPTAINER_DOCKER_USERNAME=... APPTAINER_DOCKER_PASSWORD=... \
    sbatch rl_data/scripts/comparison/run_local_qwen3_pass_at_8.sh
```

Useful overrides:

```bash
# Subset of datasets
DATASETS="et openthoughts" sbatch rl_data/scripts/comparison/run_local_qwen3_pass_at_8.sh

# Cost-bounded (250 random tasks per baseline)
SAMPLE_SIZE=250 SAMPLE_SEED=42 sbatch rl_data/scripts/comparison/run_local_qwen3_pass_at_8.sh

# Different model (Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct)
VLLM_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct \
    sbatch rl_data/scripts/comparison/run_local_qwen3_pass_at_8.sh

# Different pass@k breadth
NUM_SOLUTIONS=16 sbatch rl_data/scripts/comparison/run_local_qwen3_pass_at_8.sh
```

The vLLM helper (`_vllm_local.sh`) auto-picks tensor-parallel = 1 and
data-parallel = visible GPU count, which is the throughput-optimal config
for an 8B model that fits on one H200. Override via `VLLM_TP` / `VLLM_DP`.

For Qwen3-family models the helper additionally:

- enables `--tool-call-parser hermes` (OpenAI-compatible tool calls in our
  bash-tool agent loop),
- enables `--reasoning-parser qwen3` (so `<think>` tokens go to
  `reasoning_content`, not `content`),
- sets `--chat-template-kwargs '{"enable_thinking": false}'` to skip the
  thinking pass entirely (much faster turns; opt back in by exporting
  `VLLM_DISABLE_THINKING=0`).

### B. Two-job (separate vLLM + solver) — legacy

If you'd rather keep vLLM on one node and run solvers from another, the
older two-job recipe still works:

1. Launch vLLM on a GPU node (one-liner helper):

   ```bash
   MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct TP=1 \
       bash rl_data/scripts/generate_solutions/launch_vllm.sh
   ```

2. Point the solve script at it:

   ```bash
   export MODEL="hosted_vllm/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct"
   export HOSTED_VLLM_API_BASE="http://<vllm-host>:8000/v1"
   bash rl_data/scripts/comparison/run_generate_solutions_et.sh
   ```

The solve scripts detect `HOSTED_VLLM_API_BASE` / `OLLAMA_API_BASE` /
`OPENAI_API_BASE` and arrange the right env for `litellm.completion`. No
code changes required.

Ollama variant:

```bash
export MODEL="ollama_chat/qwen2.5-coder:7b"
export OLLAMA_API_BASE="http://localhost:11434"
```

Note: tool-calling (our bash-tool loop) requires the local backend support
OpenAI-style `tool_calls`. vLLM supports this via `--tool-call-parser
hermes` for Qwen2.5/Qwen3 (the launcher enables this by default).

## Dependencies

```bash
uv pip install scikit-learn scipy
uv pip install vllm==0.19.1    # only if running a local server
```

scipy powers Mann-Whitney U + chi-squared; scikit-learn powers TF-IDF + KMeans
in the diversity module. Both are gated — missing them logs a warning and
those sub-modules no-op rather than crashing.

## Rough cost estimate (API flash, full-run)

- Ingest: CPU-only, ~10 min for ~2500 ET tasks + ~730 OT-Agent-RL tasks +
  ~3500 TermiGen tasks + ~5660 TerminalTraj tasks + ~1450 CLI-Gym tasks.
  TermiGen's first run does a ~350 MB sparse clone of the GitHub repo;
  TerminalTraj's first run pulls a single 13 MB tarball from HF; CLI-Gym
  pulls two small parquet datasets (hamishivi + LiberCoders) via
  `datasets.load_dataset` and joins them in memory (no image pulls at
  ingest — those happen in the solve pre-build). SWE-smith similarly joins
  two parquet datasets in memory, but the verifier source
  (`SWE-bench/SWE-smith`) is ~4 GB (11 shards, ~52k bug patches), so the
  first ingest is download-bound (~5-15 min on a fast link, cached after).
- Taxonomy classifier: ~$5-8 total (~12k × one flash call each).
- Solves (NUM_SOLUTIONS=1, ~30k tokens/task): ~$30-60 for ET, <$5 for
  OT-Agent-RL, ~$40-80 for TermiGen, ~$5-10 for TerminalTraj at default
  `SAMPLE_SIZE=500` (~$60-100 for the full 5660-task run). Baseline cost
  scales linearly with `NUM_SOLUTIONS`.
- **TerminalTraj disk budget**: each per-task SIF is ~500 MB, so 500
  tasks ≈ 250 GB, 5660 ≈ 2.8 TB. Bound via `SAMPLE_SIZE`.
- **CLI-Gym disk budget**: each per-task SIF is ~900 MB, so 250 tasks
  ≈ 225 GB, ~1,452 ≈ 1.3 TB. Bound via `SAMPLE_SIZE` (default 250).
- **SWE-smith disk budget**: each per-task SIF is ~900 MB, so 250 tasks
  ≈ 225 GB. Bound via `SAMPLE_SIZE` (default 250). Many sampled tasks share
  a `<repo>.<sha>` base layer, so apptainer's layer cache reduces the
  effective pull volume below the naive per-SIF figure.
- Comparison post-processing: <10 min CPU on 10k + ~12k tasks.

Using `SAMPLE_SIZE=250` cuts any solve to ~10% of the above. Using a
local Qwen model cuts it to zero (modulo GPU wall time).
