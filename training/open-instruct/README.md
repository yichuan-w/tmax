# open-instruct (fork)

This is a fork of [allenai/open-instruct](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct).

It contains fixes on top of upstream for:

- **Qwen 3.5** support (fixed hybrid CP-SP training for SFT and RL)
- **DPPO Support** (new RL loss)
- **Terminal agent training** (podman-based sandboxes for training)

The training scripts for this fork live under [`training/open-instruct/scripts/tmax`](scripts/tmax). Please refer to the [README](scripts/tmax/README.md) for more details on how to use them. Note that we made this code and infra for training at Ai2, so you may need to modify some things to run it on your own infrastructure. For example, swapping to apptainer for sandboxing might be required, which we do not really officially support in this code.

For general documentation, usage, and the upstream codebase, refer to the [main open-instruct repository](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct). I also recommend checking it for the flags and features.

### Requirements

- `uv` for dependency management (deps pinned in the repo-root `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`).
- A Dockerhub login and personal access token (PAT). In particular, you probably need a business account to pull images from Dockerhub at large scale.
