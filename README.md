Todo: teaser figure

Tmax is our project around training simple, powerful terminal using agents. This codebase covers data generation, training, and evaluation. Please refer to our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx) for more details.

Below, we give a quick overview of the codebase and how to use it.

### News
- Initial release of the codebase and models! Please read [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxx) for more details.



## What's here

The repo is organised around four stages of building a terminal agent:

| Stage | Where | What it does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **Data generation** | `rl_data/` | A simple, scalable, diverse, difficulty-aware pipeline for synthesising terminal-agent tasks, solving them at pass@k, analysing the corpus, and publishing it to the Hugging Face Hub. Tasks are sampled as an *independent product of structured axes* and packaged as self-contained Apptainer/Docker environments with programmatic verifiers. |
| **Agent** | `Vanillux2Agent/` | The Harbor agent used for solving and evaluation: a direct LiteLLM agent built on the vanillux prompt harness (mini-SWE-agent-derived prompts, bash tool schema, submit marker, format-error recovery, and output truncation), executing commands through Harbor's active environment. |
| **Training** | `training/open-instruct/` | A fork of [open-instruct](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct) with fixes for Qwen 3.5 and terminal-agent training. SFT and DPPO RL launch scripts for the tmax models live under `training/open-instruct/scripts/tmax/`. |
| **Evaluation** | `scripts/` + `beaker_configs/` | Shell/Slurm launchers and a Beaker pipeline that serves a model with vLLM and runs Harbor datasets (Terminal-Bench, TB-Lite, SWE-bench) against it. |

## Quickstart

Python is run via [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv); all commands run from
the repo root.

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Generate task data

```bash
# 1. generate a small task corpus
NUM_TASKS=10 OUT_DIR=rl_data/output/tasks_smoke \
    bash rl_data/scripts/generate_tasks/run_generate_tasks.sh

# 2. solve the tasks with an LLM agent at pass@k
TASKS_DIR=rl_data/output/tasks_smoke \
    bash rl_data/scripts/generate_solutions/run_generate_solutions.sh

# 3. analyse pass@k + composition/balance stats
TASKS_DIR=rl_data/output/tasks_smoke \
    bash rl_data/scripts/analyze/run_analyze.sh
```

See [`rl_data/README.md`](rl_data/README.md) for the full pipeline, corpus
kinds, and SFT warm-start details.

### Train a model

SFT and DPPO RL are run via the open-instruct fork in `training/open-instruct/`.
Launch scripts for the tmax models live under `training/open-instruct/scripts/tmax/`
(`SFT/` and `RL/`):

```bash
# from training/open-instruct/, e.g. RL on Qwen3.5-4B
bash scripts/tmax/RL/qwen35_4b.sh <beaker-image>
```

See [`training/open-instruct/scripts/tmax/README.md`](training/open-instruct/scripts/tmax/README.md)
for how to read the scripts (`mason.py` launcher vs. the underlying training command)
and how to run them off-cluster.

### Evaluate a model

Run a Harbor dataset against a locally served model on Beaker:

```bash
./beaker_configs/launch_eval.sh allenai/open_instruct_dev \
    --revision sft_qwen3_4b_tmax_4node \
    --name sft-4b \
    --dataset terminal-bench@2.0
```

See [`scripts/beaker/README.md`](scripts/beaker/README.md) for the full eval
pipeline, flags, and troubleshooting.

#### Evaluate manually

To run an eval yourself on a node with GPUs (no Beaker), serve the model with
vLLM and point Harbor at it:

```bash
# 1. serve the model on localhost:8008 (a separate shell/process)
uvx vllm==0.19.1 serve allenai/tmax-9b \
    --served-model-name tmax-9b \
    --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser qwen3_xml \
    --tensor-parallel-size 8 --port 8008

# set daytona key
export DAYTONA_API_KEY='xxx'

# 3. run a Harbor dataset against the local vLLM endpoint
uv run harbor run \
  --dataset terminal-bench@2.0 \
  --env daytona \
  --agent-import-path Vanillux2Agent:Vanillux2Agent \
  --model openai/tmax-9b \
  --agent-kwarg api_base=http://localhost:8008/v1 \
  --agent-kwarg max_format_errors=64 \
  --n-concurrent 16 \
  -k 5 \
  --job-name swerl-qwen32-2b-tmax-step100-vanillux2-daytona-tblite
```

Feel free to swap out daytona for your sandboxing backend of choice.

## Requirements

- **[`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** for dependency management (deps pinned in `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`).
- An **LLM API key** for the configured model (e.g. `GEMINI_API_KEY`); local
  vLLM / Ollama / OpenAI-compatible endpoints are also supported via env vars.
- (for data generation) **`apptainer`** on PATH for building and running task containers.
- (for training) A **Dockerhub login** and personal access token (PAT). In particular, you probably need a business account to pull images from Dockerhub at large scale.
- **`HF_TOKEN`** for the Hugging Face upload stage and for pulling gated models.
